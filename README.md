Some useless scripts.

```
organize.sh - A file organizor, useful when you have 12 (or even worse, 24) videos, each 2 subtitles and tens of subsetted fonts (hundereds in total) to deal with.

part_reencode.py - A video partial re-encoder. It re-encodes only part of the video using the specified vapoursynth script and encoder params, leaving other part untouched.

BDencode.py - An encoding/organizing task manager with simple GUI. Handles the whole encoding process from m2ts/mkv to final product, including vpy generation, audio encoding, ass fonts subseting and so on.

pgs_ass_color.py - A script coloring Ass subtitles base on PGS subs.
```
